###### About Me :D
#### Summary
Computer engineering student specializing in **reverse engineering**, **Android system development**, and **low-level native programming**.  
Currently exploring **UEFI development** and **boot chain adaptation** for ARM64-based platforms (Qualcomm SoCs), primarily targeting the **Windows Platform (WoA)**.  

---

#### Core Competencies  
- **Reverse Engineering:** Disassembly of ELF payloads and analysis, Parsing/Loading ELF payloads with custom loader(s), Runtime Patching/Hooking, and Anti-reverse engineering measures.  
- **Programming:** Capable of working with most mainstream languages, such as: C, C++, C#, Java (also a bit of understanding in Java ByteCode "Smali"), Kotlin, and similar. (knowing that many languages makes easy to understand other languages that I might not have worked with :D)
- **Learning Focus:** UEFI on AArch64 devices, Mainline Linux on Snapdragon SoCs, Windows on ARM bringup on a specific device, ACPI Language logic, and Snapdragon SoCs in general.

###### I am self-taught. Don't expect me to know the subtle differences between two rarely used functions that do the same thing (in Java/Kotlin as an example) — if it works and doesn't break anything, that’s what matters :D
